Netflix, Inc. is a company from the United States that provides a service where you can watch videos whenever you want after subscribing. It's like a streaming service and is located in Los Gatos, California. It was started by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California. They have a collection of movies and TV shows that they show through agreements with others, as well as their own creations called Netflix Originals.

In this project,i have done following things:-

Exploratory Data Analysis.

Understanding what type content is available in different countries.

Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.

Problem Statement
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Define Your Business Objective?
Personalized Recommendations: Enhance user experience by providing more accurate and personalized recommendations. Clustering content can help identify user preferences and suggest similar shows or movies.

Content Curation and Discovery: Improve content discovery by organizing the vast library of movies and TV shows into meaningful clusters. This helps users easily find new content that matches their interests.

User Engagement and Retention: Increase user engagement and retention by keeping users hooked with content that aligns with their tastes. Effective clustering can lead to higher satisfaction and longer subscription durations.

Marketing and Promotion: Develop targeted marketing and promotional strategies based on user preferences. Clustering can identify popular genres or themes, allowing for more effective advertising campaigns.

Content Acquisition and Production: Inform content acquisition and production decisions by identifying trends and gaps in the current library. Clustering can reveal popular genres or niches that are underrepresented, guiding future investments.

User Segmentation: Segment users based on their viewing habits and preferences. This can help in creating tailored experiences and offers for different user groups.

Content Licensing and Partnerships: Make data-driven decisions regarding content licensing and partnerships by understanding the performance and popularity of different content clusters.

General Guidelines : -
Well-structured, formatted, and commented code is required.

Exception Handling, Production Grade Code & Deployment Ready Code will be a plus. Those students will be awarded some additional credits.

The additional credits will have advantages over other students during Star Student selection.

    [ Note: - Deployment Ready Code is defined as, the whole .ipynb notebook should be executable in one go
              without a single error logged. ]
Each and every logic should have proper comments.

You may add as many number of charts you want. Make Sure for each and every chart the following format should be answered.

# Chart visualization code
Why did you pick the specific chart?
What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact? Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.
You have to create at least 20 logical & meaningful charts having important insights.
[ Hints : - Do the Vizualization in a structured way while following "UBM" Rule.

U - Univariate Analysis,

B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)

M - Multivariate Analysis ]
